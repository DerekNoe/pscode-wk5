// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Define a function that takes 1 input
Use the % (modelo) to divide the number by 2
Have an "if" statement that returns Even if number is 0
Make an "else" statment that returns odd

(Your pseudocode here)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Define a function that takes 5 inputs
Create a variable that takes the 5 inputs and returns the sum
Create a variable that takes the 5 inputs and returns the minimum
Create a variable that takes the 5 inputs and returns the maximum
Have a final print statement that reads "The sum the numbers is (use sum variable). The minimum is (minimum variable) and max is (maximum variable)
